## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
Poor planning. Most of the tasks were under estimated.
Also we thought that the end of the sprint was on thursday not on monday.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
We have to better manage our time and do a complete planning session based on our aviable hours.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
No previous retrospective.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
No previous retrospective.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
Better coordination and time managment.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
We decided to use new technologies such as MongoDB even if we didn't know them well to learn new things together and get out of our comfort zone.
