## ASSESSMENT


- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - Better planning is better work. But we have to finish the work with 1/2 days left for merge all branches and test all functionalities.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - Better coordination between us.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - Don't do code review the last day for merge and test all function.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - Try and success in coordinate 7 people.
